# Question 8
# Keeping in mind there are 86400 seconds per day, write a program that calculates how many seconds there are in a week, if a week is 7 days.  Print the result on the screen.
# 
# Note: Your result should be in the format of just a number, not a sentence.
#
days = 7
sec_per_day = 86400
total_seconds = days*sec_per_day
print(total_seconds)

#Question 9
# Use Python to calculate how many different passwords can be formed with 6 lower case English letters.  For a 1 letter password, there would be 26 possibilities.  For a 2 letter password, each letter is independent of the other, so there would be 26 times 26 possibilities.  Using this information, print the amount of possible passwords that can be formed with 6 letters.
